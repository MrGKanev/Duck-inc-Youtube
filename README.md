## Duck Inc Youtube

DiY is an Android app, which plays audio of YouTube Videos in the background. Also, DiY provides mechanisms for searching videos, playing your playlists and downloading videos.

This is a project made for one of our clases (Software Engineering). Everybody in it had a role (Project Manager, Designer, QA and Programmer). In the folder files you can see all our documents/diagrams and etc. Everything is FAKE.

This applications is against YouTube terms of service and could not be present on Google Play Store therefore, It is developed so I can finish my Bachelor's degree (hopefully). You can download the app (hopefully) from the "release" folder.

### For other students from RU / (other universities)

If you steal anything from here at least give someone from the team a beer. It was a big challange to make it this far so I think we deserve it. Just don't steal our duck, it's our priceless possession. (And I would personally hunt you down for it!)
